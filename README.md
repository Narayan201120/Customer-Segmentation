📝 Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset of customer information. The process involves:

Data preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature scaling
Determining the optimal number of clusters
Applying K-Means clustering
Analyzing and visualizing the results
🚀 Installation
To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
yellowbrick
scikit-learn

🛠️ Usage
Download the dataset:

Place the ecom_customer_data.xlsx file in the project directory.
Run the analysis:

Open Customer_Segmentation_.ipynb in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab and execute the cells.
Results:

The script generates several plots and outputs files such as Cluster_Data.csv and Final_data.csv containing segmented customer data and summary statistics.
📊 Data Description
